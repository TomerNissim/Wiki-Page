        <h1>Maccabi Tel Aviv Football Club</h1>
        <p>
            Founded in 1906 as the HaRishon Le Zion-Yafo Association, Maccabi Tel Aviv are the oldest, largest and most decorated football club in Israel. With the establishment of the city of Tel Aviv in 1909, the club changed their name to Maccabi Tel Aviv. In 1922 they became the first Jewish football club to participate in local competitions. The meaning of the name Maccabi – ‘Who is like thee among the gods’ – forms an integral part of the character of the team, which took the Star of David as their logo to represent the Jewish people. Maccabi Tel Aviv have won more titles than any other Israeli club, winning 23 League Championships (18 after Israeli independence), 23 prestigious State Cups (17 after Israeli independence), two Asian Club Cups and an additional five Toto (League) Cups.
