                                    <p class="abouat-players">The Spanish left-back, 187cm, joined Maccabi in the summer of 2018 from Athletic Bilbao, where he made 23 appearances last season in all competitions for the La Liga club he joined in 2010.

                                    <p class="abouat-players">Eitan Tibi made his debut in the top tier of Israeli football at Beitar Jerusalem and made his maiden appearance against Hakoach Amidar Ramat Gan in the 2006/07 season. He was loaned out to second league side Hapoel Ra'anana where he played in 33 league matches.  The following season, Tibi was once again loaned out, this time to Hakoach Amidar Ramat Gan who were then playing in the Israeli Premier ("Winner") League. Tibi appeared in 28 games, scored four goals and reached the semi-finals of the coveted Israel State Cup. </p> 
                                    <p class="abouat-players">After two years on loan, Tibi returned to Beitar Jerusalem in the 2009/10 season and appeared in 21 games. In 2010/11 he joined Belgian side Charleroi but spent most of the season on the bench before returning to Israel to join Ironi Kiryat Shmona during their historic championship 2011/12 season, making 23 league appearances. His success at Kiryat Shmona drew attention from Maccabi Tel Aviv and he joined the club at the start of the 2012/13 season. </p>
                                    <p class="abouat-players">Tibi's transfer was completed just prior to the second match of the season and thereafter he missed just one other match for the balance of the season, due to yellow card accumulation. Over the course of his 34 league appearances he struck up a terrific partnership with Spanish defender Carlos Garcia as his steadfastness in central defense was a major contributing factor to Maccabi Tel Aviv's championship in the 2012/13 season. After only his first season at Maccabi Tel Aviv, Eitan Tibi made an indelible mark on the club and secured a position on the Israeli national team, playing his first match in May 2012 in an international friendly against the Czech Republic.</p>
                                    <p class="abouat-players">His second campaign with the Yellow-and-Blue was as equally successful playing in 34 out of 36 league matches helping Maccabi win the league title by a margin of 16 points. Tibi also appeared in all of the club’s Europa League matches, playing in 12 European games total in the 2013/14 season.   In the 2014/15 season Tibi continued playing a major role in the club’s defense as Maccabi gave up only 30 goals over the course of the Treble winning year.
                                        Tibi began the 2015/16 campaign in fine form as Maccabi defeated Viktoria Plzen away to advance to the Champions League playoff round and moved onto the Group Stages by aggregate over Basel. At the end of the season, the central defender signed a new contract with the club. 
                                        In 2016/17, Tibi made 49 appearances with 5 coming in the Group Stages of the Europa League. </p>
                                        <p class="abouat-players">Again in 2017/18, Tibi helped the Club advance to the Europa League, playing in the 8 qualifiers and 4 group stage matches. As part of a rotation with Tal Ben Haim and Jean-Sylvain Babin, Tibi made 42 appearances across all competitions and became the all time leader in matches played under Jordi Cruyff with 267.Tibi was one of the key players in what was another amazing season (2019/20) for Maccabi, as he played an important part in the record-breaking defense. Tibi ended a four-year-goalless-run as he scored 3 goals in 31 appearances to mark his best year at the club. At the end of the season, Tibi lifted the league title in what was his 5th championship at Maccabi and 7th personal.</p>

                                    <p class="abouat-players">Sheran Yeini came up through the youth ranks of Maccabi Tel Aviv and has remained a Maccabi player throughout his footballing career. Yeini made his debut in a League ("Toto") Cup game against Bnei Sakhnin in the 2004/05 season. Despite the club experiencing a number of unremarkable seasons, Yeini secured his first title with Maccabi after the club won the 2008/09 "Toto" Cup. That year, Yeini began to demonstrate his attacking skills, opening the season with a goal in the very first league match and ending the season with three league goals, only to repeat the achievement the following season. In 2010/11, Yeini scored one goal in the "Toto" Cup against Hapoel Tel Aviv as well as a league goal in the final match of the season against Maccabi Netanya. </p> 
                                    <p class="abouat-players">But it was not until the 2011/12 season that Yeini became one of the most prized players on the Maccabi Tel Aviv squad. His responsible and intelligent play, his leadership qualities and his ability to play well in a variety of positions both in defence and as a holding midfielder elevated him to a position of exceptional value within the club. And it was an expression of that value that Yeini received the captain's armband in several matches during that season. He scored three league goals that season and played an active role in Maccabi's maiden appearance in the group stage of the Europa League, scoring his first European goal in the club's 2-3 home loss to Turkish side Besiktas . </p> 
                                    <p class="abouat-players">In the 2012/13 championship season Yeini continued to improve his skills and in the most significant moment of his career so far, it was he who lifted the championship plate at the end of the title match. He appeared in 34 of Maccabi's 36 league matches and displayed his diverse talent by playing most of the season in the position of right back, one he was unaccustomed to playing throughout most of his career. The versatile Yeini also demonstrated his attacking skills by scoring two goals, one of spectacular quality in a home tie against Hapoel Haifa. With Yeini's responsibility for the team's captaincy, it was his leadership qualities on the pitch that helped to maintain the stability of a back line that conceded only 30 goals the entire season. </p> 
                                    <p class="abouat-players">After this multi-faceted player had already made ten appearances for the nation's Under-21s, Yeini's fine season earned him a maiden appearance for the national side in a home tie against Portugal during the 2014 World Cup qualifiers. It was his task to mark the venerated Christiano Ronaldo and Yeini made sure the Real Madrid and former Manchester United star was unable to score in a match that ended in a 3-3 draw.</p>

                             <p class="abouat-players"> Avi Rikan was born in 1988 and joined the Beitar Jerusalem youth department in 2000 where he stayed until going on loan to Maccabi Herzliya for the 2007/08 season. In 2008/09, Beitar again loaned out the midfielder to Hapoel Petach Tikva where he made 30 appearances.

He would also win the Toto Cup in his first full campaign with the club in 2010. </p> 
                             <p class="abouat-players"> Rikan joined FC Zurich from Beitar Jerusalem at the start of 2013/14 and in his first season won the Swiss Cup.

                             <p class="abouat-players"> On July 23, 2015 Rikan returned to Israel signing a three-year contract with Maccabi Tel Aviv and his impact was felt almost instantly during the club's run to the UEFA Champions League Group Stages for the 2015/16 season. He brilliantly assisted on Eran Zahavi's first goal in the Champions League first leg playoff match in Basel where his free kick pass inside the box gave Maccabi a 1:0 lead. He played in 5 of the club’s Champions League Group Stage matches and has appeared as both a defender and midfielder for the Yellow & Blue. His first goal for Maccabi came in November 2016 at Hapoel Haifa and he ended the campaign with 2 goals and one assist in 41 matches.                            </p>

                             <p class="abouat-players"> The 2017/18 season was a successful one for the midfielder. Making 52 appearances across all competitions (33 league), Rikan scored 9 goals (6 league) and added 3 assists. During the course of the campaign he also signed a new contract with the Club.
                                At the National Team level, Rikan played for both the Under-17 and Under-21 squads while making his first senior team appearance on February 6, 2013 in a friendly against Finland. </p>

                            <p class="abouat-players"> The gifted midfielder began his career at Beitar Tubruk and made his senior team debut for Maccabi Haifa in 2008. Following a number of championships and playing in the Champions League group stages with Haifa, Golasa signed with PAOK Salonika, a team with a very rich history in Greece. </p> 
                            <p class="abouat-players"> In his first season with the team, Golasa made 24 appearances for the Greek outfit while starting in 14 games during a difficult period of time where also suffered from injuries. However, despite his performance on the pitch, Golasa was unable to score a goal or pick up an assist leading Croatian Head Coach Igor Tudor to ask the Israeli to begin the season with the reserve side. </p>
                            <p class="abouat-players"> Even though Golasa was disappointed, he began training with the reserve team in all seriousness, commitment and investing of himself to prove to his Croatian coach that he belonged with the first team. A little over a month later, Golasa was called up and returned the coach’s faith in him by helping defeat Panthrakikos 2:0 earning Tudor’s confidence. </p>
                            <p class="abouat-players"> After two seasons and 50 appearances with Salonika, Eyal Golasa came back to Israel to wear the Yellow & Blue. In 2016/17, his first in Yellow & Blue Golasa scored 2 goals and recorded one assist. One of the goals came at AZ Alkmaar during the Europa League Group Stages that helped Maccabi to an important win. Golasa went on to make 33 appearances across all competitions.                            </p>
                            <p class="abouat-players"> The 2017/18 season saw Golasa play a central role in helping the Club advance to the Europa League Group Stages, however, the midfielder suffered an injury in August that kept him off of the pitch for 3 months. Despite the time away, #23 made 32 appearances across all competitions (20 league) and assisted on four goals. </p>

                            <p class="abouat-players"> Dor Peretz was promoted from the club's Under-19 team and given a place on the senior squad at the start of the 2014/15 Treble winning campaign. Peretz had joined Maccabi Tel Aviv from Hapoel Hod Hasharon in 2010 and moved his way up through the Youth Division teams until joining the Under-19s in the 2012/13 season. He spent two years with Maccabi Tel Aviv "Shachar", interrupted only by an injury that kept him out of action for three months in his second season. During that time he scored four goals before joining the senior squad. </p> 
                            <p class="abouat-players"> Peretz wasted no time in appearing in the starting eleven with 90 minutes against Maccabi Netanya in the "Toto" (League) Cup. He made two more League Cup appearances, against Hapoel Ra'anana and Hapoel Petach Tikva, Maccabi's rival in the home-away quarter finals. In the second leg Peretz came off the bench and his smart long-range effort represented his first official goal as a member of the first team. </p> 
                            <p class="abouat-players"> The 2015/16 season began with Peretz moving from the central defender position he played during the prior year to the midfield spot he plays now. Peretz came in as a substitute in both Basel legs and started the play that led to Eran Zahavi's second goal of the away match. He also began the League campaign in the starting lineup. Peretz earned his first Champions League minutes at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea when he came on as a substitute. His first goal was against Maccabi Haifa in a 2:0 win at Sammy Ofer Stadium. He finished the season with 38 appearances, one goal and a pair of assists. </p> 
                            <p class="abouat-players"> In 2016/17 he made 19 appearances under new head coach Shota Arveladze and picked up two assists. Peretz was then loaned out to Hapoel Haifa in January for the balance of the season. </p> 
                            <p class="abouat-players"> The 2017/18 season saw Peretz become a key part of the Yellow & Blue and played the central defender role, replacing veteran Gal Alberman. His goal at Hapoel Beer Sheva helped defeat the Southern Reds 1:0 for their first ever home league loss at Turner Stadium. In total, #42 made 24 league appearances under Head Coach Jordi Cruyff. </p>

                            <p class="abouat-players">Ben Chaim returned for a second spell at Maccabi Tel Aviv in July 2020 after spending three years with Sparta Prague. </p>
                            <p class="abouat-players">A product of Maccabi Petah Tikva’s Youth Department, Tal Ben Chaim, made his senior top-flight debut against Bnei Yehuda in May 2008. Ben Chaim who scored 22 goals in all competitions for Petah Tikva’s U-19’s side, scored his debut senior goal against Hapoel Tel Aviv on the penultimate match of the season. After a barren season in which he only scored 3 goals for Petah Tikva’s youth team but none for the senior side, the 2009/10 campaign proved to be Ben Chaim’s breakthrough season as he scored 10 goals and continued with 13 goals in the following 2010/11 campaign. Having scored a total of 29 goals for Petah Tikva, Ben Chaim joined Hapoel Tel Aviv in the summer of 2012 and made his debut in a Toto Cup derby against Maccabi and finished the season with 9 goals in all competitions.</p>
                            <p class="abouat-players">Ben Chaim then joined Maccabi ahead of the 2013/14 campaign and made his first appearance in Yellow and Blue under Paulo Souza during the Champions League qualifier against Hungarian side Gyori. Ben Chaim, opened his account the following week as he scored in the return leg against Gyori before helping the side reach the Europa League group stage and the round of 32 in the competition. The talented winger added four more league goals and five assists which helped him celebrate his first league title and Maccabi’s second championship in succession.</p>
                            <p class="abouat-players">Ben Chaim played an integral part in Maccabi’s historic 2014/15 treble winning season under Pako Ayestaran as he scored 11 goals and added 7 assists in 48 appearances in all competitions. In the summer of 2015, Ben Chaim helped Maccabi qualify to the Champions League group stage under Slavisa Jokanovic and played in all the matches against Chelsea, Porto and Dynamo Kiev. The 2015/16 season however ended in a sour note with the loss of the championship to Hapoel Be’ersheva by a solitary point and a State Cup final defeat to Maccabi Haifa, but Ben Chaim racked-up 13 goals and 4 assists in 50 appearances in all competitions.</p>
                            <p class="abouat-players">Ben Chaim reached the Europa League group stage with Maccabi for the second time in the 2016/17 season, as the winger ended the campaign with 19 goals and 7 assists in 50 appearances in all competitions which prompted his transfer to Sparta Prague in July 2017.</p>
